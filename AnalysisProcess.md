## Analysis Outlier 

1. Chech the condition of this dataset

When it comes to Linear Regression, it is unreasonable to "blatantly" assume its compatibiltiy to the dataset. Therefore, it ios important to first check the data's quality by looking at 

Description: (a) There were no typos or unusual values (b)Treatment group: - Tequila: The distribution seems to be normal with a little bit right-skewed - Water: this treatment group particularly
has reaction unchanged throughout the sample. This implies that water (the placebo treatment)
has no effect on BAC level - White wine: The distribution seems to be left-skewed - Mai Tai: the
distribution is right-skewed - Reguler Beer: The distribution is right-skewed
